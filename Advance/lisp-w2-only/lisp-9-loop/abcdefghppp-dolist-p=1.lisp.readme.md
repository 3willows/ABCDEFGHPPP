### Warning not for kid programmer, primary 1 or not

#### Horrible lisp-9-loop

Well it qualifies to join the Advance challenge done 2 on top of base 10.

Just take hours to complete and still waiting for the base 28 result!

... 

Macbook Air 13 inchese Early 2014

10 18s
16 1145s  or 19 min+
22 18839s or 5 hours+ :-)
28 still runnning after 1 day
34 you are joking!!

Well as I stress again it run 16 and 22, it qualify the  Advance challenge.

Todo:

To be fair some minor changes should be done e.g. like the function one by snastudio, I should 

1) reverse the loop
2) cut loop that is not viable (ef+gh=ppp first 4 loops for e f g h and possibly later ab-cd=ef)
3) Possibly ensure the lower level loop do not duplicate the counter variables on higher level e.g. when one do it in reverse start with h from 0, 2 to (base - 1), then g should be 2 to (base - 1) but not the h of that loop.

... and may be easier to deal with array with fixed data type optimisation to better the function one :-)
