### Same version of lisp for Advance challenge as at 2016-03-31

This is the frozen version of those two.

To run the lisp, you can use say sbcl and run the xxx.lisp file using 

$sbcl --script xxx.lisp 

Todo-

The maintenance effort would move to Advance version to get the func version to work under w4 constraint and well, for the horrible 9-loop version for the w2 to work "better".

Cheers!
